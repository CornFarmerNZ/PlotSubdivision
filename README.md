# PlotSubdivision
A Java program for subdividing plots

- *The Optimal strategy Algorithm* is a dynamic programming approach that solves it in moderate speed, but guarantees the optimal solution every time.
- *The Greedy choice* is the fastest, but shows that choosing the 'Greedy choice' does not always result in the optimal solution. 
- *The Brute force approach* is by far the slowest, and as the name suggests, finds a solution via brute force.
